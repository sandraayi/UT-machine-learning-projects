# ET EasyVisa: Visa Recommender System Using Ensemble Learning

## Project Overview  
This project aimed to build a **recommendation system** to classify visa applications based on applicant profile data using supervised machine learning. It leveraged real-world data to identify patterns and generate targeted recommendations, simulating the complexity of real-world government decision processes.

## Objective  
To develop an accurate and interpretable machine learning model that classifies visa applications as "approve" or "reject" based on demographic, employment, and academic characteristics.

## Tools & Methods  
- Languages: Python, Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Ensemble Learning: Voting Classifier (Hard + Soft Voting)  
- Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix, ROC AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall  

## Key Results  
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting individually performed well  
- Ensemble voting classifier improved classification stability  
- Best ensemble model achieved **accuracy of 93%** with strong generalization  

## My Insights  
While building this project, I recognized the importance of:
- **Balancing model complexity and interpretability**, especially when decisions affect individuals (e.g., visa or clinical eligibility)
- **Data pre-processing and feature encoding** as critical steps before modeling
- The value of **model ensemble strategies** in reducing bias and variance

This experience deepened my ability to think through **decision-making frameworks in regulated environments**, which parallels clinical settings where nuanced patient data informs high-stakes decisions.

## Clinical Application of Skills  
The skills honed in this project translate directly to healthcare:
- **Classification models** can support triage systems, eligibility for interventions, or referral pathways.
- **Ensemble models** offer robustness in unpredictable real-world clinical data environments.
- The **interpretability of features** informs transparencyâ€”crucial when clinicians or patients need to understand model decisions.
