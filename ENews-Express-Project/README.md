# ENews Express Learner: Automated News Categorization Using NLP

## Project Overview  
This project applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning to automate the classification of news articles into relevant categories such as Politics, Sports, Business, Entertainment, and Technology. By building an efficient and scalable pipeline, it demonstrates the potential of NLP for real-time text classification tasks.

## Objective  
To develop a robust model that accurately categorizes unstructured news articles based on their textual content using supervised learning and NLP techniques.

## Tools & Techniques  
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, NLTK  
- NLP Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization, TF-IDF  
- Classifiers Used:  
  - Naïve Bayes  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## Key Results  
- Best performing model: **Multinomial Naïve Bayes** with over **91% accuracy**
- TF-IDF vectorization significantly improved model performance  
- NLP pipeline achieved consistent and interpretable classification

## My Insights  
This project emphasized the power of **text vectorization** and the role of **feature selection** in working with unstructured clinical or textual data. I also gained deeper experience in:
- Evaluating NLP models not just by accuracy, but by understanding **false positives and category overlap**
- Building clean, reusable preprocessing pipelines applicable to various real-world datasets

## Clinical Application of Skills  
The methods used here translate well to:
- **Triage systems** that classify patient symptoms from free-text chief complaints
- **EHR mining**, where unstructured clinical notes are categorized or flagged for review
- **Patient feedback analysis** for public health or quality improvement
