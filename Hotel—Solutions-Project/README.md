# INNHotels Market Segmentation & Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview  
This project explored hotel customer segmentation using unsupervised learning to better understand booking behaviors, preferences, and customer value. Based on cluster insights, it introduced a recommendation strategy to tailor services to high-value guest segments and improve retention.

## Objective  
To analyze hotel booking data and segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering, enabling the business to develop targeted offerings and improve customer satisfaction.

## Tools & Techniques  
- Data exploration using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
- Clustering algorithms:  
  - K-Means  
  - Hierarchical Clustering  
- Validation methods: Silhouette score, Elbow method  
- Business recommendations based on cluster profiles

## Key Findings  
- Identified **4 distinct customer segments**, including:
  - High-value frequent travelers
  - Budget-conscious families
  - Corporate solo travelers
  - Seasonal leisure guests
- **K-Means clustering** delivered optimal segmentation with strong silhouette score
- PCA enhanced interpretability while reducing feature noise

## My Insights  
This project emphasized the role of **unsupervised learning in service design** and customer experience. It helped me:
- Translate raw booking data into personas with distinct behaviors
- Use cluster-based reasoning to simulate how healthcare populations might be grouped for personalized interventions

## Clinical Application of Skills  
These methods are highly relevant for healthcare:
- Clustering can support **population health management** by identifying groups with similar care needs or risks
- PCA and segmentation can simplify large clinical datasets for **targeted care pathways**
- Strategy design from data insights strengthens **evidence-based decision-making**
